	Hash table
	
It is necessary to implement the Dictionary data structure based on the hash table data structure. The dictionary data structure should store the following key – string / character array data, value – string / character array data. The dictionary data structure should support the following operations:

• Add-ons (key, value)

• Removal (key)

• Search (key) with return value

Use the Pierce Direct Method as a hash function.

Use the chaining method as the collision resolution method to prevent duplicate key-value additions.

For the "Hash Table" you must create the functions:

• Add-ons

• Removal

• Search

• Hash function calculation

• Collision Resolutions

• Rehash

To demonstrate the capabilities of the developed diabetes need to implement a menu.
