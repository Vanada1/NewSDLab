	Abstract Data Structures
	
1. It is necessary to implement the Abstract Data Structure (ASD) “Stack” without using previously implemented data structures. It is allowed to use only basic C ++ features (pointers, basic data types, structures).

For the "Stack" you must create the functions:

• stack creation

• Stack (Push) Functions

• The function of extraction from the stack (Pop)

• Deleting a stack (clearing memory)

2. It is necessary to implement ASD "Ring buffer"

For the “Ring buffer” it is necessary to implement the functions:

• Function returns free space

• The function returns the occupied place

• Function to add an item to the buffer

• Function retrieving an item from the buffer

3. It is necessary to implement "Queue" on a ring-based buffer (from paragraph 2).

4. It is necessary to implement the Queue ASD on the basis of 2 stacks (from clause 1). For the "Queue" (Clause 3 and Clause 4), it is necessary to create functions:

• Create a queue

• Queue function (Enqueue)


• Function of extraction from queue (Dequeue)

• Deleting a queue (clearing memory)

For each ASD, it is necessary to implement the function of changing the buffer size, if necessary
