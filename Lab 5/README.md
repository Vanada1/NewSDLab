# Lab 5
	Search trees without balancing.
	
Implement the binary search tree data structure. Implement functions:

• Creating a tree

• Add item

• Delete item

• Search for an item

• Search for maximum tree

• Search for a minimum tree

Implement the Cartesian tree data structure. Implement functions:

• Creating a tree (initialization)

• Search for an item

• Split function

• Merge function

• Implement adding an element using a non-optimized algorithm (1 Split, 2 Merge)

• Implement addition using optimized algorithm (1 Split)

• Implement element deletion using non-optimized algorithm (2 Split, 1 Merge)

• Implement removal using an optimized algorithm (1 Merge)

• Removing tree items (clearing memory)

Demonstration of the capabilities of the program based on the menu.
